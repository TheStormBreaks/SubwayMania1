# SubwayMania


My Recipe for my WhiteHat Jr. homework is Subway. Because i 
absolutely love Subway.

Also, there are different flavours of Subway as well. But my 
recipe if for the Veggie Delight.

To make a veg subway sandwich, a whole lot of juicy veggies, 
black olives and lettuce are lined with cheese and mayonise, 
stuffed between almost footlong bread.
